// Portfolio

// A page that displays your creations (items).
// For top-marks, this page must be populated from an external API.
// If you are unable to demonstrate this page calling an external API, and perhaps, instead rendering data from an array of Javascript objects, your marks will significantly decrease.
// Search, with a form that allows users to search for items based on certain criteria (e.g., selected from a drop-down list, entered into a text box, or by automatically determining the userâ€™s location using HTML5 Geolocation API)
// When clicked/tapped, each item must open to a page for itself
